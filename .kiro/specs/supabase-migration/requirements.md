# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature migrates PharmGPT from a file-based storage system to use Supabase exclusively as the database backend. The migration will improve performance, scalability, and enable advanced features like real-time collaboration and better data management while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Database Migration

**User Story:** As a PharmGPT user, I want all my data (conversations, documents, user accounts) to be stored in Supabase so that I can benefit from improved performance and reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL connect to Supabase database exclusively
2. WHEN a user creates an account THEN the system SHALL store user data in Supabase users table
3. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate against Supabase database
4. WHEN conversations are created or updated THEN they SHALL be stored in Supabase conversations table
5. WHEN documents are uploaded THEN metadata SHALL be stored in Supabase documents table
6. WHEN the system needs to load data THEN it SHALL query Supabase exclusively (no file fallback)

### Requirement 2: Data Migration from Files

**User Story:** As an existing PharmGPT user, I want my existing conversations and documents to be automatically migrated to Supabase so that I don't lose any data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects existing file-based data THEN it SHALL automatically migrate all data to Supabase
2. WHEN migration occurs THEN all user accounts SHALL be preserved with correct authentication
3. WHEN migration occurs THEN all conversations SHALL be preserved with correct timestamps and metadata
4. WHEN migration occurs THEN all document metadata SHALL be preserved and linked to correct conversations
5. WHEN migration is complete THEN the system SHALL create a backup of original files
6. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback options

### Requirement 3: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a PharmGPT user, I want the Supabase integration to be fast and efficient so that the app remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading conversations THEN response time SHALL be under 200ms for typical datasets
2. WHEN saving conversations THEN the system SHALL use batch operations for efficiency
3. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL use proper indexes and optimized queries
4. WHEN multiple operations occur THEN the system SHALL use connection pooling
5. WHEN data is frequently accessed THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching
6. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL clear unused caches automatically

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a PharmGPT user, I want the system to handle database errors gracefully so that I have a reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Supabase is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL queue operations for retry
3. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error feedback
4. WHEN connection timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL automatically retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN data conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL resolve them using last-write-wins strategy
6. WHEN critical errors happen THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging

### Requirement 5: Security and Data Privacy

**User Story:** As a PharmGPT user, I want my data to be secure in Supabase so that my conversations and documents remain private.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL use Row Level Security (RLS) policies
2. WHEN users authenticate THEN passwords SHALL be properly hashed and salted
3. WHEN data is transmitted THEN it SHALL use encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS)
4. WHEN users access data THEN they SHALL only see their own conversations and documents
5. WHEN sessions expire THEN users SHALL be automatically logged out
6. WHEN sensitive operations occur THEN they SHALL be logged for audit purposes

### Requirement 6: Configuration and Setup

**User Story:** As a PharmGPT administrator, I want easy configuration options for Supabase so that I can set up and maintain the system efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN Supabase credentials SHALL be loaded from Streamlit secrets
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL validate Supabase connection and configuration
3. WHEN database schema is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup instructions
4. WHEN environment variables are incorrect THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages
5. WHEN switching from file-based storage THEN the configuration change SHALL be simple
6. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information

### Requirement 7: Monitoring and Analytics

**User Story:** As a PharmGPT administrator, I want to monitor database performance and usage so that I can optimize the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL track response times
2. WHEN queries are slow THEN the system SHALL log performance warnings
3. WHEN connection issues occur THEN the system SHALL track and report them
4. WHEN usage patterns change THEN the system SHALL provide analytics data
5. WHEN optimization is needed THEN the system SHALL suggest improvements
6. WHEN monitoring data is collected THEN it SHALL be displayed in an admin dashboard

### Requirement 8: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a PharmGPT user, I want all existing features to work exactly the same after migration so that my workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the chat interface THEN all functionality SHALL work identically to before
2. WHEN uploading documents THEN the RAG system SHALL function the same way
3. WHEN managing conversations THEN all operations SHALL be preserved (create, delete, duplicate)
4. WHEN switching between conversations THEN performance SHALL be maintained or improved
5. WHEN using authentication THEN login/logout behavior SHALL remain the same
6. WHEN accessing user settings THEN all preferences SHALL be preserved
