# AsyncIO Event Loop Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing AsyncIO event loop warnings:
```
WARNING:services.user_service:AsyncIO event loop issue for user e4443c52948edad6132f34b6378a9901, reinitializing client
```

This occurs when async clients get bound to different event loops, which is common in Streamlit applications due to how Streamlit handles async operations.

## Root Cause
- Supabase async clients were getting bound to specific event loops
- When Streamlit created new event loops (during reruns or session changes), the existing clients became invalid
- The application was trying to use clients bound to old/different event loops

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Event Loop Detection in UserService
- Added `_event_loop_id` tracking to detect when event loops change
- Added `_check_event_loop()` method that:
  - Gets the current running event loop ID
  - Compares with stored loop ID
  - Resets client and connection manager if loop changed

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Improved `get_user_by_id()` method to use connection manager instead of direct client
- Added fallback logic that reinitializes connection manager on AsyncIO errors
- More robust retry mechanism for event loop issues

### 3. Connection Manager Improvements
- Added event loop detection to `SupabaseConnectionManager`
- Reset client state when event loop changes detected
- Enhanced `get_client()` method to check event loops before returning client

### 4. Proactive Client Management
- Modified `_ensure_client()` to check event loops before initialization
- Added connection manager reinitialization on event loop changes
- Better error categorization for AsyncIO vs other errors

## Code Changes

### services/user_service.py
- Added `_event_loop_id` tracking
- Added `_check_event_loop()` method
- Enhanced `_ensure_client()` with event loop checking
- Improved `get_user_by_id()` to use connection manager
- Better AsyncIO error handling and recovery

### supabase_manager.py
- Added `_event_loop_id` tracking to connection manager
- Added `_check_event_loop()` method
- Enhanced `get_client()` with event loop validation
- Reset client state on event loop changes

## Testing
- Created `test_asyncio_fix.py` to verify fixes
- Confirmed AsyncIO warnings no longer appear
- Event loop resilience working correctly

## Benefits
1. **No More AsyncIO Warnings**: Event loop binding issues resolved
2. **Better Reliability**: Automatic recovery from event loop changes
3. **Improved Performance**: Reduced client reinitialization overhead
4. **Streamlit Compatibility**: Better handling of Streamlit's async behavior
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Proper fallback mechanisms

## Monitoring
The fixes include enhanced logging to track:
- Event loop changes
- Client reinitialization events
- Connection manager state changes
- Error recovery attempts

This should resolve the AsyncIO event loop warnings you were seeing in your Streamlit application.
